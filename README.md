ðŸŒ² Random Forest Classifier (from scratch)

This project implements a Decision Tree and a Random Forest Classifier completely from scratch in Python using only NumPy and basic Python libraries.
No scikit-learn models are used â€” only for testing and dataset loading.

ðŸ“Œ Features

- Implementation of Decision Tree Classifier with:

Gini impurity

Recursive tree building

Stopping conditions (max_depth, min_split)

- Implementation of Random Forest Classifier with:

Bootstrapped sampling

Random feature selection at each tree

Majority voting for predictions

- Test script using the Iris dataset.
